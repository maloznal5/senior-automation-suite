# Case Study: AI-Powered B2B Order Manager

## 🎯 Project Overview
Automation of order processing for a large hardware store (krepezh.ua). The goal was to eliminate manual matching of client requests with a 10,000+ item catalog.

## 🛠 Technical Solution
- **AI Core**: Integration of LLM (OpenAI/Gemini) for natural language processing of messy customer orders.
- **Matching Engine**: Developed a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to match client "slang" names with official catalog nomenclature.
- **Infrastructure**: High-performance AsyncIO backend capable of handling concurrent requests.

## 📈 Business Results
- **Efficiency**: Reduced order processing time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds.
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ matching accuracy for non-standard item descriptions.
- **Scalability**: The system handles 24/7 load without human intervention.
